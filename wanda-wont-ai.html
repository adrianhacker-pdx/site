					<h1>Wanda Won't A.I.</h1>
<p>Unofficially, this blog post is titled "Wanda Won't A.I." and it refers to my beautiful calico kitty who, if she were a person, I know would loathe the idea of artificial intelligence. Just as the robot vacuum has evolved to scare Wanda more thoroughly, so too has technology evolved to make people frightened. Enter: Artificial Intelligence. Perhaps the Matrix or Terminator 2 are plausible scenarios on the horizon people are wondering about. No, both A.I. and the robot vacuum are just two different facets of technology that is much older than people realize. And equally as harmless (mostly). Some interesting parallels exist in history around general fears of new technology.</p>

<h2>Some History of Technology and Fear</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The Locomotive – "Faster Than a Speeding Horse!" (Early 19th Century): When the first steam locomotives chugged onto the scene, people were terrified. They thought traveling at speeds of over 30 mph would cause the human body to melt! Imagine that – "Honey, I'm just off to melt on the 8:15 to Manchester."
</li>

<li>
The Telegraph – "Wires of Witchcraft!" (Mid-19th Century): The telegraph was basically the WhatsApp of the 1800s. But, not everyone was thrilled. Some thought these invisible messages sent through wires were the work of dark forces. "Beware the witchcraft that sends words without wings!"
</li>

<li>
The Telephone – "The Devil's Instrument" (Late 19th Century): When Alexander Graham Bell's invention started connecting people, some feared it was an instrument of evil. There were concerns about electricity's potential to carry voices of the dead. "Hello, is it me you're looking for?" might have had a whole different meaning back then.
</li>

<li>
Electricity – "It's Electrifying, and Terrifying!" (Late 19th Century): The introduction of electricity into homes was met with skepticism and fear. People were worried about being electrocuted by light switches. "Turn on the light? I'd rather not dance with death today, thank you."
</li>

<li>
The Automobile – "Horseless Madness!" (Early 20th Century): The early cars were seen as noisy, smelly, and dangerous beasts compared to the trusty horse. There were even laws requiring a person to walk in front of a car waving a red flag. "Beware, the horseless carriage cometh!"
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Balancing Act: Navigating the Cat-and-Mouse Game with A.I.</h2>
<p>In the world of technology, as in the world of cats, a delicate balancing act often unfolds. Just as a cat teeters between curiosity and caution when investigating a new object, we find ourselves navigating the intricate relationship between the risks and rewards of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

<h3>Understanding the Risks</h3>
<p>Just as we wouldn't want our adventurous feline friends to dart into danger, it's crucial to acknowledge the potential risks associated with AI. Some concerns include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Loss of Control: Allowing AI systems to make critical decisions without human oversight can be risky. Just as we guide our cats away from harm, we must maintain control over AI's actions.
</li>
<li>
Deepfakes and Misinformation: AI's ability to generate convincing deepfakes and spread misinformation can be concerning. Like deciphering a cat's intentions, it can be challenging to discern truth from fiction.
</li>
<li>
Bias and Discrimination: AI algorithms can inherit biases present in their training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes. Just as we strive for fairness and equality, we must ensure AI systems do the same.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Embracing the Rewards</h3>
<p>Much like when a cat finally pounces and captures its elusive prey, there are rewarding aspects to embracing AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Problem-Solving: AI can tackle complex problems that were once beyond our grasp. Just as a cat's patience pays off during a stealthy hunt, AI's problem-solving capabilities can lead to breakthroughs in various domains.
</li>
<li>
Enhanced Quality of Life: AI-driven innovations can enhance our daily lives, from smart homes that adjust to our preferences to personalized medical treatments. Just as a cat seeks comfort and convenience, AI strives to provide the same.
</li>
<li>
Innovation and Progress: Just as cats adapt to their ever-changing environment, embracing AI can drive innovation and progress in our rapidly evolving world. AI is the catalyst for groundbreaking discoveries and technological advancements.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Striking the Balance</h3>
<p>So, how do we strike the right balance between the risks and rewards of AI? Much like observing a cat's behavior to ensure their safety, here are some strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Ethical Guidelines: Establish clear ethical guidelines for AI development and usage to mitigate potential risks and ensure responsible AI practices.
</li>
<li>
Oversight and Accountability: Maintain human oversight over AI systems to prevent unintended consequences and hold individuals and organizations accountable for AI-related actions.
</li>
<li>
Education and Awareness: Educate ourselves about AI to better understand its capabilities and limitations, enabling us to make informed decisions.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is Machine Learning Anyway? Machine Learning Explained</h2>
<p>Machine learning can be broken down into two different types: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.</p>

<h3>Supervised Learning: "Math as a Pattern Detective"</h3>
<p>In supervised learning, think of mathematics as a detective solving a puzzle. The puzzle is to find a function (a mathematical model) that best describes the relationship between input data (features) and output data (labels).</p>
<ul>
<li>
Data: Labeled data (e.g., pictures of cats and dogs with "cat" or "dog" labels).
</li>
<li>
Mathematics at Work:
<ul>
<li>
Statistical Analysis: It starts with statistical methods to understand data features.
</li>
<li>
Function Approximation: The core task is to approximate a function (think of it like y = f(x)) that can predict the output (y) for a new input (x).
</li>
<li>
Optimization: Algorithms like gradient descent are used to minimize errors in predictions.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Goal: To create a mathematical model that can accurately predict the label for new, unseen data.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsupervised Learning: "Math as a Pattern Explorer"</h3>
<p>In unsupervised learning, mathematics is like an explorer trying to map out an unknown territory. The goal is to explore data and find some inherent structure or patterns without any predefined labels.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Data: Unlabeled data (like a mix of different objects).
</li>
<li>
Mathematics at Work: 
<ul>
<li>
Clustering Algorithms: Methods like K-means clustering where the algorithm tries to group data into clusters based on similarities.
</li>
<li>
Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduce the complexity of data, making patterns more visible.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Goal: To discover hidden patterns or groupings in the data.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Common Thread: Algorithms and Statistics</h3>
<p>Both types of learning rely heavily on algorithms (step-by-step mathematical procedures) and statistical methods. These are not alien concepts but extensions of mathematics and statistics applied to data. The computer is essentially doing a lot of calculations and predictions based on the mathematical models it builds from the data.</p>

<h2>Visualizing a Supervised Learning Function</h2>
<p>Imagine you're dealing with a basic linear regression problem, which is a common type of supervised learning. Here's how you might visualize it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Graph Setup:
<br />
X-Axis: Represents the input feature (e.g., the size of a house).<br />
Y-Axis: Represents the output or prediction (e.g., the price of the house).
</li>
<li>
Data Points:
<br />
Plot data points on this graph. Each point represents a known example from your dataset (e.g., a house of a certain size and its corresponding price).
</li>
<li>
The Learning Function:
</li>
Draw a line through these points. This line is your machine learning function. In linear regression, it's the "best fit" line that minimizes the distance (error) between itself and all the data points.
The equation of this line (like y = mx + b) is what the machine learning model has learned. Here, 'm' is the slope, and 'b' is the y-intercept.<br /><br />
<li>
Prediction:
</li>
To make a prediction, you input a new value of X (e.g., the size of a new house) and see where it hits the line on the graph. The corresponding Y value is your predicted price.</ul>
<h2>Tools to Create This Visualization:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Software like Excel or Google Sheets: You can plot the data points and add a trendline.
</li>
<li>
Programming Languages: Python with libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn is excellent for more complex data.
</li>
<li>
Online Graphing Tools: Websites like Desmos allow you to plot points and lines easily.
</li>
</ul>
<p>This visualization helps you see how the machine learning model (in this case, the line) is making predictions based on the input data. It’s a simple yet powerful way to understand the basics of supervised learning functions.
<br />
<br />
Now head over to my portfolio area where you can look at some examples of machine learning.  So far I have the facial recognition applet up and functioning.  This uses machine learning to look at your face and determine your mood (or moods).  More playground stuff with machine learning to come in the very near future (this week or next).  Check back frequently for portfolio updates.
<br />
<br />
Respectfully,
Adrian Hacker
<br />
<br />
p.s.
<br />
I just had Wanda read this article that I have written, and I can tell she is much more at ease. She isn’t a big fan of all the math and could really care less about all of that, but she can see that it isn’t alien technology that will usurp our humanity from us overnight.
